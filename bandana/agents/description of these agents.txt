NON-NEGOTIATING AGENTS:

- DumbBot
	A simple heuristic player developped by David Norman. Although a fairly straightforward implementation it still
	plays reasonaby well and is widely used as a default 'baseline' bot for researchers to compare their own bots with.
	
	Note that the orginal DumbBot was implemented in C++ for the DAIDE framework. This is an alternative JAVA implementation
	of that bot, implemented for the DipGame framework. There is no guarantee that it is exactly identical to the original 
	DumbBot.
	
	Furthermore, we have made a slight adaptation to this bot specially for BANDANA, namely that for this version of the
	DumbBot you can specify a 'final year' after which it will automatically propose a draw.
	

- D-Brane
	This agent is the winner of the Computer Diplomacy Challenge, held at the ICGA Computer Games Olympiad 2015.
	
	This is version 1.1 of D-Brane, which does not negotiate. A negotiating version of this agent also exists but 
	we have not included it in this framwork. We do hope to	add	it in the future.
	
	Version 1.0 of D-Brane was previously made available. The only difference between v1.0 and v1.1 is a number of small
	bug fixes. 
	
NEGOTIATING AGENTS:

- RandomNegotiator
	This is the agent used in the manual to demonstrate how to implement a negotiating agent. 
	
	It just makes random moves, proposes random proposals, and randomly decides whether to accept incoming
	proposals or not.
	
	The source code of this agent can be found in the folder src/ddejonge/bandana/exampleAgents
	
- DBraneExampleBot
	This is the agent used in the manual to demonstrate how to implement a negotiation algorithm on top of the 
	Tactical module of D-Brane.
	
	The source code of this agent can be found in the folder src/ddejonge/bandana/exampleAgents
